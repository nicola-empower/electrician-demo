This is **Volt Master**.

The video shows a dark, sleek, premium design. This isn't for a "fix a light switch" handyman. This is for a "Smart Home Integration Specialist."

To sell this to an electrician for £3k+, we need to pivot away from just "fixing wires" and towards **"Intelligent Electrical Solutions."** We need to make the sparky reading this feel like the Tony Stark of tradesmen.

Here is the homepage copy for **Volt Master**.
